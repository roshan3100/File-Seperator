# File-Seperator
Seperates the different file in windows

In this project i am going to separate the files, the different  files like doc file pptx file txt file  will be saved in different folder. like doc file will be saved in doc folder and text file in text folder same way other files.
In this program  i am opening the directory and taking a file and checking the file is doc or txt or in which format and when the format is known by program it saves the file in that format file directory and if the file is not present then it will create a folder name with that format name and showing all files present in that directory.
So we can easily within a second we can seperate thousand of files and all the different format files will be saved in different folder.
I think this is the simplest way to seperate files and the same concept can be use to save similar files in any respect ( when created or who created) in different folders and this same concept can be use many other programs to develop any app like java or android or windows.
I have not learnt graphics otherwise i can make a file operating system that will saw us files folder in graphical view and this program will be much interesting.
